   way to open a text document inside the editor, not this function.
   
   **Parameters:**
   - `target`: `Uri` - The uri that should be opened.
   
   **Returns:** `Thenable<boolean>` - A promise indicating if open was successful."

(defn as-external-uri
  "Resolves a uri to a form that is accessible externally.
   
   #### `http:` or `https:` scheme
   
   Resolves an *external* uri, such as a `http:` or `https:` link, from where the extension is running to a
   uri to the same resource on the client machine.
   
   This is a no-op if the extension is running on the client machine.
   
   If the extension is running remotely, this function automatically establishes a port forwarding tunnel
   from the local machine to `target` on the remote and returns a local uri to the tunnel. The lifetime of
   the port forwarding tunnel is managed by the editor and the tunnel can be closed by the user.
   
   *Note* that uris passed through `openExternal` are automatically resolved and you should not call `asExternalUri` on them.
   
   #### `vscode.env.uriScheme`
   
   Creates a uri that - if opened in a browser (e.g. via `openExternal`) - will result in a registered {@link UriHandler }
   to trigger.
   
   Extensions should not make any assumptions about the resulting uri and should not alter it in any way.
   Rather, extensions can e.g. use this uri in an authentication flow, by adding the uri as callback query
   argument to the server to authenticate to.
   
   *Note* that if the server decides to add additional query parameters to the uri (e.g. a token or secret), it
   will appear in the uri that is passed to the {@link UriHandler }.
   
   **Example** of an authentication flow:
   ```typescript
   vscode.window.registerUriHandler({
     handleUri(uri: vscode.Uri): vscode.ProviderResult<void> {
       if (uri.path === '/did-authenticate') {
         console.log(uri.toString());
       }
     }
   });
   
   const callableUri = await vscode.env.asExternalUri(vscode.Uri.parse(vscode.env.uriScheme + '://my.extension/did-authenticate'));
   await vscode.env.openExternal(callableUri);
   ```
   
   *Note* that extensions should not cache the result of `asExternalUri` as the resolved uri may become invalid due to
   a system or user action â€” for example, in remote cases, a user may close a port forwarding tunnel that was opened by
   `asExternalUri`.
   
   #### Any other scheme
   
   Any other scheme will be handled as if the provided URI is a workspace URI. In that case, the method will return
   a URI which, when handled, will make the editor open the workspace.
   
   **Parameters:**
   - `target`: `Uri`
   
   **Returns:** `Thenable<Uri>` - A uri that can be used on the client machine."
