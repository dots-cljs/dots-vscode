  "The filesystem provider defines what the editor needs to read, write, discover,
   and to manage files and folders. It allows extensions to serve files from remote places,
   like ftp-servers, and to seamlessly integrate those into the editor.
   
   * *Note 1:* The filesystem provider API works with {@link Uri uris} and assumes hierarchical
   paths, e.g. `foo:/my/path` is a child of `foo:/my/` and a parent of `foo:/my/path/deeper`.
   * *Note 2:* There is an activation event `onFileSystem:<scheme>` that fires when a file
   or folder is being accessed.
   * *Note 3:* The word 'file' is often used to denote all {@link FileType kinds} of files, e.g.
   folders, symbolic links, and regular files.")

(defn on-did-change-file
  "An event to signal that a resource has been created, changed, or deleted. This
   event should fire for resources that are being {@link FileSystemProvider.watch watched}
   by clients of this provider.
   
   *Note:* It is important that the metadata of the file that changed provides an
   updated `mtime` that advanced from the previous value in the {@link FileStat stat} and a
   correct `size` value. Otherwise there may be optimizations in place that will not show
   the change in an editor for example."

(defn watch
  "Subscribes to file change events in the file or folder denoted by `uri`. For folders,
   the option `recursive` indicates whether subfolders, sub-subfolders, etc. should
   be watched for file changes as well. With `recursive: false`, only changes to the
   files that are direct children of the folder should trigger an event.
   
   The `excludes` array is used to indicate paths that should be excluded from file
   watching. It is typically derived from the `files.watcherExclude` setting that
   is configurable by the user. Each entry can be be:
   - the absolute path to exclude
   - a relative path to exclude (for example `build/output`)
   - a simple glob pattern (for example `**â€‹/build`, `output/**`)
   
   It is the file system provider's job to call {@linkcode FileSystemProvider.onDidChangeFile onDidChangeFile}
   for every change given these rules. No event should be emitted for files that match any of the provided
   excludes."
